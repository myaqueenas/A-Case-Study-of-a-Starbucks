### Abstract
Background: CRM has been used in various industries as a tool for growth to strengthen customer loyalty. Implementing CRM-based marketing methods at Starbucks, where customer loyalty is key, can help to succeed in marketing and operational aspect. However, Starbucks operations and marketing tend to rely on intuition and personal experience.

Aims: In order for marketing and operations based on CRM to be introduced to Starbucks, customer loyalty should be predicted with big data technologies, and what type of customer repurchase in this implementation is reviewed. The prediction-based marketing and operations are also proposed.

Key literature: “Big data and business analytics: A research agenda for realizing business value” can be representative of key literature in this study. This article contains information on big data research to realize business value and is closely related to this study. It is also to aggregate existing knowledge to reveal the association between big data and business analysis and to present the importance of potential research and practice.

Proposed Methodology: The method of quantitative and inductive research was adopted for this study. In addition, Customer loyalty is predicted using three classification models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression), and the most appropriate model is found.

Outcomes: It is possible to compare the performances (Cohen’s Kappa, Accuracy and AUC) and ROC curves after applying the three models to the test set to determine the optimal method of customer loyalty prediction. Extract specific customer groups with relationships with customer loyalty and present the most appropriate marketing and operation. The dataset used in this study was collected in Malaysia and published on the website Kaggle. Hence, the dataset may be small in size, and the Malaysian unique customer behaviour patterns may have been reflected in the study. Finally, although no data analysis has been performed in this study, it will be a consistent research design that could have a positive impact on CRM-based marketing and operations.
